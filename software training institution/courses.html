  <h1>BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY</h1><hr>
  <img src="courses images/bc1.jfif" alt="">
  <h4>Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner. Each transaction is grouped into a "block" and linked to the previous block, forming a chain. This ensures data integrity through cryptographic algorithms and consensus mechanisms, eliminating the need for intermediaries in processes like financial transactions, supply chain management, and digital identity verification.</h4>
</div>

<div class="container1"><br>
  <h1>MOBILEAPPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</h1><hr>
  <img src="courses images/ma2.jfif" alt="">
  <h4>Mobile application development is the process of designing, building, and deploying software applications for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It involves selecting a development platform (iOS, Android, or cross-platform frameworks), creating a user-friendly interface, coding functionalities, integrating backend services, and testing for performance, security, and compatibility. The goal is to deliver a seamless, engaging, and efficient user experience tailored to the target audience's needs.</h4>
</div>
<br>
<div class="container1"><br>
  <h1>SOFTWARE TESTING & (QC)</h1><hr>
  <img src="courses images/st3.jfif" alt="">
  <h4>Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to ensure it meets specified requirements and is free of defects. It involves executing the software under controlled conditions to identify bugs, verify functionality, assess performance, and ensure reliability, usability, and security. The goal is to deliver a high-quality product that meets user expectations and performs as intended.</h4>
